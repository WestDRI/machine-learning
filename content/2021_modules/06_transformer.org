[[http://jalammar.github.io/about/][Jay Alammar]] is a blogger whose blogs have been referenced in MIT and Stanford courses due to their quality.

[[http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/][His blog on The Transformer]] in particular does a great job at explaining the most powerful deep learning model to date which gave rise to [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805][the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)]] from Google and [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165][GPT-3]] from [[https://openai.com/][OpenAI]]. Jay goes over that blog in the following 30 min video.

Transformers are extremely complex and this video is the best resource I have found to ease into understanding them.

For reference, [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762][here]] is the actual paper describing the Transformer.
