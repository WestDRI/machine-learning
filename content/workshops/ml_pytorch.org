* Machine learning vs deep learning: which tool to use

Thoughts and ideas:

- pick the right tool

   + simple algorithms might be good enough. Neural networks might be overkill
   + does your code really run faster if you have access to GPU rather than CPU?
   + deep learning (usually needs GPU): TensorFlow, PyTorch
   + machine learning which is not deep learning (CPU usually ok):
