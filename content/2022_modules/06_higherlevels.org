* Higher-level frameworks

Several popular higher-level frameworks are built on top of PyTorch and make the code easier to write and run:

   - [[https://github.com/pytorch/ignite][ignite]] is developed by the PyTorch project. It is the easiest to combine with raw PyTorch, but not the easiest to use.
   - [[https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning][PyTorch-lightning]] is probably the most popular. It makes some operations (e.g. using multiple GPUs) very easy, but some of the Lightning products are not free.
   - [[https://github.com/fastai/fastai][fastai]] adds several interesting concepts to PyTorch borrowed from other languages, but debugging can be challenging.
   - [[https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst][Catalyst]]

The following tags trends on Stack Overflow might give an idea of their popularity over time (catalyst doesn't have any Stack Overflow tag):

* Should you use one (and which one)?

Learning raw PyTorch is probably the best option for research.

Depending on your deep learning trajectory, you might find some of these tools useful.
