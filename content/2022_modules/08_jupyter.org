* JupyterHub access

For this course, we will use a temporary JupyterHub running on one of our training clusters.

For today, here is how to log in:

- Go to [[https://kandinsky.c3.ca][https://kandinsky.c3.ca]]

- Sign in with the username & password you just got (leave OTP blank)

{{<imgmshadow src="/img/jh_login.png" margin="4rem 0 0 0" title="" width="45%" line-height="0rem">}}
{{</imgmshadow>}}

- Set the server options as follows:

{{<imgmshadow src="/img/jh_widget_black_1.png" margin="4rem 0 0 0" title="" width="%" line-height="0rem">}}
{{</imgmshadow>}}

- Press start
   
#+BEGIN_note
Note that, unlike other JupyterHubs you might have used (e.g. [[https://syzygy.ca/][syzygy.ca]]), this JupyterHub is not permanent and can only be used for this course.
#+END_note

* Jupyter tips

** Help

~help~ is a Python built-in function (it is a wrapper around ~pydoc.help~) which provides some help on code elements (functions, etc.). While some of the tips presented here only work on Jupyter, this also works in the Python shell:

#+BEGIN_src python
help(sum)
#+END_src

** Autocompletion

Pressing ~Tab~ after a few characters of code autocompletes or displays available options. This also works in the Python shell.

** Function arguments

Pressing ~Shift+Tab~ inside the parentheses of a function opens a popup showing all the function arguments and their default values (if any).

** Information

In Jupyter, you can access information on a Python element by prepending or appending a question mark to it:

#+BEGIN_src python
?sum
sum?
#+END_src

** Source code

By using two question marks, you can see the source code:

#+BEGIN_src python
??sum
sum??
#+END_src

** Important menus

- File/Save As:{{<m>}} rename your notebook
- File/New Launcher:{{<m>}} open a new launcher dashboard, e.g. to start a terminal
- File/Logout:{{<m>}} terminate your job (your Jupyter session is running inside a Slurm job)

** Main key bindings

*** Mode switching

- Esc:{{<m>}} leave edit mode and enter command mode (in command mode, the cell border is blue)
- Enter:{{<m>}} leave command mode and enter edit mode (in edit mode, the cell border is green)

*** Key bindings for both modes

- Ctrl+Enter:{{<m>}} execute current cell
- Alt+Enter:{{<m>}} execute current cell and insert cell below
- Shift+Enter:{{<m>}} execute current cell and focus on cell below
- Ctrl+S:{{<m>}} save notebook and checkpoint

*** Key bindings in command mode

- "Up/Down":{{<m>}} navigate to the cell above/below
- "A":{{<m>}} insert a cell above the current cell
- "B":{{<m>}} insert a cell below the current cell
- "X":{{<m>}} cut the current cell
- "C":{{<m>}} copy the current cell
- "V":{{<m>}} paste the previously cut or copied cell
- "M":{{<m>}} turn the current cell into a markdown cell
- "H":{{<m>}} display help
