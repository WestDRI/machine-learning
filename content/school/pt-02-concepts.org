* What is machine learning?

Machine learning (ML) can be defined as computer programs whose performance at a task improves with experience.

Since this experience comes in the form of *data*, ML consists of feeding vast amounts of data to algorithms to strengthen *pathways*.

**** /Example in image recognition:/

Coding all the possible ways—pixel by pixel—that a picture can represent a certain object is an impossibly large task. By feeding examples of images of that object to a neural network however, we can train it to recognize that object in images that it has never seen (without explicitly programming how it does this!).
