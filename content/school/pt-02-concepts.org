* What is machine learning?

Machine learning (ML) can be defined as computer programs whose performance at a task improves with experience.

Since this experience comes in the form of *data*, ML consists of feeding vast amounts of data to algorithms to strengthen *pathways*.

**** /Example in image recognition:/

Coding all the possible ways—pixel by pixel—that a picture can represent a certain object is an impossibly large task. By feeding examples of images of that object to a neural network however, we can train it to recognize that object in images that it has never seen (without explicitly programming how it does this!).

* Supervised learning

You have been doing supervised machine learning for years without thinking about it in those terms:

- *Regression* is a form of supervised learning with continuous output
- *Classification* is supervised learning with discrete output

Supervised learning uses training data in the form of example input/output \((x_i, y_i)\) pairs.

/Goal:/

If \(X\) is the space of inputs and \(Y\) the space of outputs, the goal is to find a function \(h\) so that\\
for each \(x_i \in X\), \(h_\theta(x_i)\) is a predictor for the corresponding value \(y_i\) \\
(\(\theta\) represents the set of parameters of \(h_\theta\)).

→ i.e. we want to find the relationship between inputs and outputs.

* Unsupervised learning

Here too, you are familiar with some form of unsupervised learning that you weren't thinking about in such terms:

Clustering, social network analysis, market segmentation, PCA ... are all forms of unsupervised learning.

Unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data (training set of \(x_i\)).

/Goal:/

Find structure within the data.
