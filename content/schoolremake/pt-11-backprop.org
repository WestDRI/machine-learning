/Note: there is one minor terminology error in this video./

When using mini-batches (instead of all training examples) before re-calculating the weights and biases, they talk about *stochastic gradient descent*. In fact, what they are describing in the video is called *mini-batch gradient descent*. Stochastic gradient descent uses a single example in each iteration.
