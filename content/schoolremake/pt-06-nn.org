[[https://www.3blue1brown.com/][3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson]] has a series of 4 videos on neural networks which is easy to watch, fun, and does an excellent job at introducing the functioning of a simple neural network.

{{<br>}}
*This first video (19 min) introduces neural networks.*

Watch it beyond the acknowledgement fragment as the function ReLU (a really important function in modern neural networks) is introduced at the very end.
