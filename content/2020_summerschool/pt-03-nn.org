[[https://www.3blue1brown.com/][3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson]] has a series of 4 videos on neural networks which is easy to watch, fun, and does an excellent job at introducing the functioning of a simple neural network.

This is a great introduction to everything we will do in PyTorch, so *make sure to watch those videos (64 min total)* before our next meeting on Zoom.

/Note:/

As you develop your own ML models, if you find that your background in linear algebra or calculus is shaky, 3blue1brown has very good series of videos on these subjects as well.
