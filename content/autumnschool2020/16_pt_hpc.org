Whether you are using our training cluster (which is a virtual machine hosted in the cloud and mimicking a Compute Canada cluster) or one of Compute Canada clusters (e.g. Cedar or Graham), when you ~ssh~ into the cluster, you "arrive" on the login node.

*Do not run anything computationally intensive on this node*. To run your code, you need to start an interactive job or submit a batch job to Slurm (the job scheduler used by the Compute Canada clusters).

If you are not familiar with HPC, you can go through [[https://wgschool.netlify.app/hpc-menu/][the material of the HPC course we offered in this summer school]], [[https://westgrid.github.io/trainingMaterials/getting-started/#introduction-to-westgrid-compute-canada-and-hpc][the training resources on the WestGrid website]], and [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeCQbAbRSKR8gg6ZMFof1Hf9YF_-n31Ym][the Compute Canada introductory videos]].

This lesson goes over what we will do in this course, using our training cluster (of course, [[https://westgrid-ml.netlify.app/schoolremake/pt-03-local.html][if you run the code locally (on your computer)]], you can simply launch Python).

* Plots

Do not run code that displays plots on screen. Instead, have them written to files.

* Data

** Copy files to/from the cluster

*** Few files

If you need to copy files to or from the cluster, you can use ~scp~.

****** From your computer

If you are in a local shell, run:

#+BEGIN_src sh
[local]$ scp </local/path/to/file> <user>@<hostname>:<path/in/cluster>
#+END_src

/(Replace {{<c>}}&lt;user&gt;{{</c>}} by your user name and {{<c>}}&lt;hostname&gt;{{</c>}} by the hostname—for this workshop: ~uu.c3.ca~.)/

****** From the cluster

If you are in a remote shell (through ~ssh~), run:

#+BEGIN_src sh
[remote]$ scp <user>@<hostname>:<cluster/path/to/file> </local/path>
#+END_src

*** Large amount of data

Use [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Globus][Globus]] for large data transfers.

Note that Compute Canada is planning to store classic ML datasets on its clusters in the future. So if your research uses a common dataset, it may be worth inquiring whether it might be available before downloading a copy.

** Large collections of files

The Compute Canada clusters are optimized for very large files and are slowed by large collections of small files. Datasets with many small files need to be turned into single-file archives with {{<c>}}tar{{</c>}}. *Failing to do so will affect performance not just for you, but for all users of the cluster.*

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ tar cf <data>.tar <path/to/dataset/directory>/*
#+END_src

/Notes:/

- If you want to also compress the files, replace {{<c>}}tar cf{{</c>}} with {{<c>}}tar czf{{</c>}}
- As a modern alternative to {{<c>}}tar{{</c>}}, you can use [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Dar][Dar]]

* Interactive jobs

Interactive jobs are useful for code testing and development. They are not however the most efficient way to run code, so you should limit their use to testing and development.

You start an interactive job with:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ salloc --account=def-<account> --cpus-per-task=<n> --gres=gpu:<n> --mem=<mem> --time=<time>
#+END_src

Our training cluster does not have GPUs, so for this workshop, do not use the ~--gres=gpu:<n>~ option.

For the workshop, you also don't have to worry about the ~--account=def-<account>~ option (or, if you want, you can use ~--account=def-sponsor00~).

Our training cluster has a total of 60 CPUs on 5 compute nodes. Since there are many of you in this workshop, *please be very mindful when running interactive jobs*: if you request a lot of CPUs for a long time, the other workshop attendees won't be able to use the cluster anymore until your interactive job requested time ends (even if you aren't running any code).

Here are my suggestions so that we don't run into this problem:

- Only start interactive jobs when you need to understand what Python is doing at every step, or to test, explore, and develop code (so where an interactive Python shell is really beneficial). Once you have a model, submit a batch job to Slurm instead
- When running interactive jobs on this training cluster, only request 1 CPU (so ~--cpus-per-task=1~)
- Only request the time that you will really use (e.g. for [[https://westgrid-ml.netlify.app/schoolremake/pt-07-tensor.html][the lesson on Python tensors]], maybe 30 min to 1 hour seems reasonable)
- If you don't need your job allocation anymore before it runs out, you can relinquish it with {{<b>}}Ctrl+d{{</b>}}

#+BEGIN_simplebox
/Note:/ \\
In this workshop, we will submit jobs from ~/home~. This is fine on some of the Compute Canada clusters as well. Be aware however that [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Running_jobs#Cluster_particularities][you are not allowed to do that on Cedar]]. Instead, on Cedar, you have to submit jobs from ~/scratch~ or ~/project~.
#+END_simplebox

* Batch jobs

As soon as you have a working Python script, you want to submit a batch job instead of running an interactive job. To do that, you need to write an {{<b>}}sbatch{{</b>}} script.

** Job script

Here is an example script:

#+BEGIN_src sh
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=<name>*			  # job name
#SBATCH --account=def-<account>
#SBATCH --time=<time>				  # max walltime in D-HH:MM or HH:MM:SS
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=<number>      # number of cores
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:<type>:<number>    # type and number of GPU(s) per node
#SBATCH --mem=<mem>					  # max memory (default unit is MB) per node
#SBATCH --output=%x_%j.out*		  # file name for the output
#SBATCH --error=%x_%j.err*		  # file name for errors
#SBATCH --mail-user=<email_address>*
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL*

# Load modules
# (Do not use this in our workshop since we aren't using GPUs)
# (Note: loading the Python module is not necessary
# when you activate a Python virtual environment)
# module load cudacore/.10.1.243 cuda/10 cudnn/7.6.5

# Create a variable with the directory for your ML project
SOURCEDIR=~/<path/project/dir>

# Activate your Python virtual environment
source ~/env/bin/activate

# Transfer and extract data to a compute node
mkdir $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
tar xf ~/projects/def-<user>/<data>.tar -C $SLURM_TMPDIR/data

# Run your Python script on the data
python $SOURCEDIR/<script>.py $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
#+END_src

/Notes:/

- {{<c>}}%x{{</c>}} will get replaced by the script name and {{<c>}}%j{{</c>}} by the job number
- If you compressed your data with {{<c>}}tar czf{{</c>}}, you need to extract it with {{<c>}}tar xzf{{</c>}}
- {{<c>}}SBATCH{{</c>}} options marked with a {{<c>}}*{{</c>}} are optional
- There are various other options for [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Running_jobs#Email_notification][email notifications]]
- You may wonder why we transferred data to a compute node:

This makes any I/O operation involving your data a lot faster, so it will speed up your code.

So first, we create a temporary data directory in {{<b>}}$SLURM_TMPDIR{{</b>}}:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ mkdir $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_simplebox
{{<s>}}The variable {{<b>}}$SLURM_TMPDIR{{</b>}} is created by Slurm on the compute node where a job is running. Its path is {{<b>}}/localscratch/&lt;user&gt;.&lt;jobid&gt;.0{{</b>}}. Anything in it gets deleted when the job is done.
#+END_simplebox

Then we extract the data into it:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ tar xf ~/projects/def-<user>/<data>.tar -C $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
#+END_src

If your data is not in a tar file, you can simply copy it to the compute node running your job:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ cp -r ~/projects/def-<user>/<data> $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
#+END_src

** Job handling

**** Submit a job

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ cd </dir/containing/job>
$ sbatch <jobscript>.sh
#+END_src

**** Check the status of your job(s)

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ sq
#+END_src

{{<b>}}PD{{</b>}} = pending\\
{{<b>}}R{{</b>}} = running\\
{{<b>}}CG{{</b>}} = completing (Slurm is doing the closing processes) \\
No information = your job has finished running

**** Cancel a job

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ scancel <jobid>
#+END_src

**** Display efficiency measures of a completed job

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ seff <jobid>
#+END_src

* GPU(s)

** GPU types

Several Compute Canada clusters have GPUs. Their numbers and types differ:

{{<img src="/img/summerschool2020/cc_gpu.png" title="" width="%" line-height="1rem">}}
From <a href="https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Using_GPUs_with_Slurm">Compute Canada Wiki</a>
<br><br>
{{</img>}}

The default is {{<b>}}12G P100{{</b>}}, but you can request another type with {{<c>}}SBATCH --gres=gpu:&lt;type&gt;:&lt;number&gt;{{</c>}} (example: {{<c>}}--gres=gpu:p100l:1{{</c>}} to request a 16G P100 on Cedar). Please [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Using_GPUs_with_Slurm#Specifying_the_type_of_GPU_to_use][refer to the Compute Canada Wiki]] for more details.

** Number of GPU(s)

#+BEGIN_export html
<font color="#bf540c"><b>Try running your model on a single GPU first.</b></font>
#+END_export

It is very likely that you do not need more than one GPU. Asking for more than you need will greatly increase your waiting time until your job is run. The lesson on [[https://westgrid-ml.netlify.app/schoolremake/pt-15-distributed.html][distributed computing with PyTorch]] gives a few information as to when you might benefit from using several GPUs and provides some links to more resources. We will also offer workshops on distributed ML in the future. In any event, you should test your model before asking for several GPUs.

** CPU/GPU ratio

Here are Compute Canada recommendations:

*Béluga*:\\
No more than 10 CPU per GPU.

*Cedar*:\\
P100 GPU: no more than 6 CPU per GPU.\\
V100 GPU: no more than 8 CPU per GPU.

*Graham*:\\
No more than 16 CPU per GPU.

* Code testing 

It might be wise to test your code in an interactive job before submitting a really big batch job to Slurm.

** Activate your Python virtual environment

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ source ~/env/bin/activate
#+END_src

** Start an interactive job

/Example:/

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ salloc --account=def-<account> --gres=gpu:1 --cpus-per-task=6 --mem=32000 --time=0:30:0
#+END_src

** Prepare the data

Create a temporary data directory in {{<b>}}$SLURM_TMPDIR{{</b>}}:

#+BEGIN_src sh
(env) $ mkdir $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_simplebox
/Note:/ {{<s>}}The variable {{<b>}}$SLURM_TMPDIR{{</b>}} is created by Slurm on the compute node where a job is running. Its path is {{<b>}}/localscratch/&lt;user&gt;.&lt;jobid&gt;.0{{</b>}}. Anything in it gets deleted when the job is done.
#+END_simplebox

Extract the data into it:

#+BEGIN_src sh
(env) $ tar xf ~/projects/def-<user>/<data>.tar -C $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
#+END_src

** Try to run your code

Play in Python to test your code:

#+BEGIN_src sh
(env) $ python
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_src python
>>> import torch
>>> ...
#+END_src

/Note:/ {{<s>}}if you want to exit the virtual environment:

#+BEGIN_src sh
(env) $ deactivate
#+END_src

* Checkpoints

Long jobs should have a checkpoint at least every 24 hours. This ensures that an outage won't lead to days of computation lost and it will help get the job started by the scheduler sooner.

For instance, you might want to have checkpoints every {{<b>}}n{{</b>}} epochs (choose {{<b>}}n{{</b>}} so that {{<b>}}n{{</b>}} epochs take less than 24 hours to run).

In PyTorch, you can create dictionaries with all the information necessary and save them as {{<b>}}.tar{{</b>}} files with {{<c>}}torch.save(){{</c>}}. You can then load them back with {{<c>}}torch.load(){{</c>}}.

The information you want to save in each checkpoint includes the model’s {{<b>}}state_dict{{</b>}}, the optimizer’s {{<b>}}state_dict{{</b>}}, the {{<b>}}epoch{{</b>}} at which you stopped, the latest training {{<b>}}loss{{</b>}}, and anything else needed to restart training where you left off.

/Example:/

Saving a checkpoint during training could look something like this:

#+BEGIN_src python
torch.save({
    'epoch': <last epoch run>,
    'model_state_dict': net.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
    'loss': <latest loss>,
}, <path/to/checkpoint-file.tar>)
#+END_src

To restart, initialize the model and optimizer, load the dictionary, and resume training:

#+BEGIN_src python
# Initialize the model and optimizer
model = <your model>
optimizer = <your optimizer>

# Load the dictionary
checkpoint = torch.load(<path/to/checkpoint-file.tar>)
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
epoch = checkpoint['epoch']
loss = checkpoint['loss']

# Resume training
model.train()
#+END_src

* TensorBoard on the cluster

[[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard][TensorBoard]] allows to visually track your model metrics (e.g. loss, accuracy, model graph, etc.). It requires a lot of processing power however, so if you want to use it on a Compute Canada cluster, *do not run it from the login node.* Instead, run it as part of your job. This section guides you through the whole workflow.

** Launch TensorBoard

First, you need to launch TensorBoard in the background (with a trailing ~&~) before running your Python script. To do so, ad to your {{<b>}}sbatch{{</b>}} script:

#+BEGIN_src sh
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/<your log dir> --host 0.0.0.0 &
#+END_src

/Example:/

#+BEGIN_src sh
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH ...
...

tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/<your log dir> --host 0.0.0.0 &
python $SOURCEDIR/<script>.py $SLURM_TMPDIR/data
#+END_src

** Create a connection between the compute node and your computer

Once the job is running, you need to create a connection between the compute node running TensorBoard and your computer.

First, you need to find the hostname of the compute node running the Tensorboard server. This is the value under {{<b>}}NODELIST{{</b>}} for your job when you run:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ sq
#+END_src

Then, *from your computer*, enter this {{<c>}}ssh{{</c>}} command:

#+BEGIN_src sh
[local]$ ssh -N -f -L localhost:6006:<node hostname>:6006 <user>@<cluster>.computecanada.ca
#+END_src

/(Replace {{<c>}}&lt;node hostname&gt;{{</c>}} by the compute node hostname you just identified, {{<c>}}&lt;user&gt;{{</c>}} by your user name, and {{<c>}}&lt;cluster&gt;{{</c>}} by the name of the Compute Canada cluster hostname—e.g. beluga, cedar, graham.)/

** Access TensorBoard

You can now open a browser (on your computer) and go to http://localhost:6006 to monitor your model running on a compute node in the cluster!

* Running several similar jobs

A number of ML tasks (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization][hyperparameter optimization]]) require running several instances of similar jobs. Grouping them into a single job with [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/GLOST][GLOST]] or [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/GNU_Parallel][GNU Parallel]] reduces the stress on the scheduler.
